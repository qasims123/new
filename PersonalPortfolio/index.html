		<p id="welcome">Welcome to My Software Development Portfolio</p>

		<p id="portfolioText">Hello and welcome! My name is Mohammed Qasim Siddiq, and I'm thrilled to have you here at my software development portfolio. With a passion for problem-solving and a keen eye for detail, I've dedicated myself to mastering the craft of software development.

		Throughout my journey, I've honed my skills across a diverse range of technologies and methodologies, allowing me to tackle challenges with creativity and precision. From crafting elegant user interfaces to architecting robust backend systems, I thrive on bringing ideas to life through code.</p>

		<p id="welcome">Why Software Development?</p>

		<p id="portfolioText">Software development isn't just about writing lines of code—it's about crafting solutions that make a difference. Whether it's streamlining processes, enhancing user experiences, or pushing the boundaries of innovation, I believe in the transformative power of technology to drive positive change.</p>

		<p id="welcome">My Skill Set</p>

		<p id="portfolioText">In my arsenal, you'll find proficiency in a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and tools. From front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to backend technologies like Python, Node.js, and SQL, I'm willing to tackle projects of any scale and complexity.

		I'm well-versed in agile methodologies, ensuring efficient collaboration and rapid iteration throughout the development lifecycle. Additionally, my experience with version control systems like Git enables seamless collaboration and code management within teams.</p>

		<p id="welcome">What Sets Me Apart</p>

		<p id="portfolioText">What sets me apart is not just my technical skillset, but also my commitment to continuous learning and growth. In a fast-paced industry where innovation is key, I'm always eager to stay ahead of the curve, exploring emerging technologies and refining my skills to deliver exceptional results. I have self taught almost all of my skillset so far and i feel as though that says enough in itself for how comitted and learned i am in something as complex as Software Development. There is always room to improve and as of yet nowhere near a master but I am willing to do what it takes and put as much effort in required and even more to be successful in this industry.</p>

		<p id="welcome">Let's Collaborate</p>

		<h1 id="aboutMe">About Me</h1>
		<p id="portfolioText">My pursuits outside of professional endeavours encompass a dedicated involvement in various physical disciplines, reflecting my commitment to personal fitness and discipline. A passionate enthusiast of Thai boxing, I consistently engage in rigorous training sessions, leveraging the sport's techniques to enhance both physical endurance and mental resilience. Complementing this, my active engagement at the gym showcases a disciplined routine fostering strength, agility, and overall well-being. Furthermore, my journey in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has been significant, achieving a commendable level of proficiency attaining the orange and white belt during my junior years. This experience not only reinforced my dedication to mastering intricate martial arts techniques but also instilled in me the values of perseverance, strategy, and continuous self-improvement. These hobbies not only embody my commitment to maintaining a healthy lifestyle but also demonstrate my capability to channel discipline, focus, and determination into various aspects of my life. </p>

		<p id="portfolioText">From a young age, my interest in coding was ignited during high school when I delved into ICT, using and learning the basics of Python at the age of 13. This early exposure fostered a deep fascination with computer science, leading me to pursue it at A Level. While my academic grades may not fully portray my proficiency, my practical experience and intermediate skills in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python paired with fundamental skills in programming languages like React and Redux speak volumes. Through independent study and practical application, I've honed my skills in these core languages, delving into their intricacies and functionalities. This self-driven learning journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in coding, empowering me to handle diverse projects and confidently navigate the intricate world of programming. I currently am continuing to learn online to further reinforce these skills.</p>
